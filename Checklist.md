Below is a set of frequently asked questions you need to answer, if you want to implement a cryptocurrency algorithmic trading bot yourself or if you want us to make one for you. Try being as specific as you possibly can.

- Strategy
  - What type of trading strategy you want implemented (say, if it is an arbitrage strategy, what kind of arbitrage you want: basic, statistical, rebalancing, etc...)?
  - What's considered to be a trading opportunity for the bot?
  - What are desired conditions to enter a trade (TA params, indicators, signaling, etc)?
  - What are the exit conditions?
  - What are your risk management requirements?
  - Do you want to trade with one account or multiple accounts within each exchange?
- Access
  - Which exchanges you want?
  - Which pairs/instruments you want?
- Technology
  - Do you want REST over HTTP?
  - Do you need Websockets to receive market data feeds directly from the exchanges (this is usually faster than REST)?
  - Do you need to proxify your requests? (to work around exchange request rate limits)
  - Which parameters you want for control?
  - Which external datasources / online services you want for insights and signals?
  - Do you want it to have a GUI or a network access to your bot?
  - Do you want to run it from your computer?
  - Do you want chat integrations, or do you want to control it from your mobile?
- Testing
  - Do you want it to have backtesting (trade simulation with recent data)?
  - Do you want paper trading capabilities (trade simulation in real time)?
  - Do you want to conduct a test of your strategy before running it in real action?
- Scalability
  - Do you want a large-scale High-Frequency Trading operation across multiple countries or a personal trading bot (do you want lowest latencies possible for HFT, or intra-day trading only)?
  - Do you want to have it online in a distributed network of leased vds/vps close to the exchange?
